      Action Needed: Share With Us Your WDS Title
    </h2>
    The best and most important part about WDS is you. Each year, every attendee plays an important part in creating the overall WDS experience. This year we want to commision and give everyone the opportunity to create their own WDS title.  
    {' '}

    Here are some examples from our team:

    <table className="time-table">
      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <td>WDS Core Team Titles</td>
        </tr>
        <tr><td>Chris Guillebeau - Ringleader</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Jolie Guillebeau - Chief Emotional Officer</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Nicky Hajal - Resident Genius</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Wes & Tera Wages - Media Moguls</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Tina Hart - Viceroy of Volunteers</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Shauna Noah - First Lady of Fun</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Michelle Chang - Voice of Reason</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Jedd Chang - Ambassador of Aloha</td></tr>
        <tr><td>David Van Veen - Talent Wrangler</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Steven Peterson - Designated Survivor</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Denise Ransome - Creative Catalyst</td></tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>
