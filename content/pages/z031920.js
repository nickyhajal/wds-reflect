    ## WDS Community Call #1 
I wasn't sure if people would want to hang out online ... but it seems like many of us do. :) 

<p>Accordingly, we're going to plan another one of these calls soon, and perhaps some kind of structure for those who would like to connect by video call on a more regular basis.</p>  

<p>Until then, take care of yourself over there ... we need you!</p>
