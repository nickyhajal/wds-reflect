    ## WDS Community Call #1 
For everyone who _was_ able to join (our apologies again), thank you so much! I wasn't sure if people would want to hang out online ... but it seems like many of us do. :) 

<p>Accordingly, we're going to plan another one of these calls soon, and perhaps some kind of structure for those who would like to connect by video call on a more regular basis.</p>  

<p>Until then, take care of yourself over there ... we need you!</p>

<p>Yours in sanitization,</p>

<p>Chris Guillebeau</p>
