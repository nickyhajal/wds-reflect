    ## Why WDS?
    Way back in 2011, we invited 500 friends to Portland, Oregon. Our common curiosity brought us together to explore one question: _How do we live a remarkable life in a conventional world?_  

Fast forward to 2022, and we’re still exploring that question every summer with an in-person gathering that has now included **more than 10,000 people from all 50 states and more than 40 countries** since we started. The stakes and stories have grown each year with activities like Bollywood dancing, Academies, Guinness World Records, and the creation of a foundation that offers grants to individuals to pursue their dreams and positively impact their community. We call them “Scholarships for Real Life”. 
    
    With almost a full week of events and an unforgettable keynote speaker-filled weekend, you'll learn from unconventional thinkers, acquire powerful new skills, and go away with an all-new community of friends and supporters.
  
    This summer, adventurers from all over the world (you!) will join us in Portland for our final gathering, WDS X. We'll celebrate 10 years of **Community, Adventure,** and **Service** and our shared pursuit of postively impacting the world.
