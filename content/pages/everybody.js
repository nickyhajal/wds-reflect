##About our Everybody efforts

From the beginning, WDS has been an event focused on community, adventure, and service.

We have always been an affirming and inclusive community. However, we do _not_ have tolerance for intolerance. When groups of people are threatened or victimized, we will speak out, and we will take action.

With the unprecedented rhetoric against immigrants, Muslims, minorities, and other historically disadvantaged groups unfolding in our world, WDS is taking a more active stand for social justice.
