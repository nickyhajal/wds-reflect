   Your WDS ticket provides access to events, meetups, activities, and parties throughout the WDS week, including two days of main stage talks. Some additional activies such as Academies and Supper Clubs will be available for purchase and are exclusive for WDS tickets holders. A WDS ticket also provides access to the online attendee Hub and our event mobile app.
    
   Please review all of the following information carefully:
   * WDS tickets are **non-refundable.**  
   * There is no physical ticket. Only a photo-ID is required to check-in at WDS.
   * In the case where a ticket cannot be used, WDS tickets can be transferred until **May 17, 2020**. Please note a **$100 transfer fee** must be successfully paid per ticket to complete the transfer.
   * Special benefits and perks associated with the _Alumni Early-Bird ticket_ are not transferrable.
   * Once the transfer deadline has passed, the ticket will still be held for the original purchaser. 
   * Becuase we are a non-sponsored, non-commercial event, all ticket revenue goes towards the operating cost of WDS.
