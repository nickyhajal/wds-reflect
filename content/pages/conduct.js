**WDS is dedicated to providing a harassment-free conference experience for everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, or religion (or lack thereof).**

We do not tolerate harassment of event participants in any form. Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate for any event venue, including talks, workshops, parties, and online media. Attendees violating these rules may be sanctioned or expelled from WDS without a refund at the discretion of the organizers.

Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, religion, sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events, deliberate misgendering or use of “dead” or rejected names, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention.

If a participant engages in harassing behavior, the organizers may take any action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender or expulsion from the event with no refund.

If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact a team member or Ambassador immediately. Team members can be identified with distinct badges, and Ambassadors can be identified with distinct t-shirts in addition to distinct badges.

WDS team members will help participants contact venue security or local law enforcement, provide escorts, or otherwise assist anyone experiencing harassment to feel safe for the duration of the event.

We expect participants to follow these rules throughout the full WDS experience, including all related meetups and any unofficial gatherings that involve our attendees.
