    ## WDS Academies will return for 2018! 
At a WDS Academy, you might learn how to travel hack your way to a life-changing travel experience, master the art of telling compelling stories, or develop a winning branding strategy for your business. 
You'll have the opportunity to learn something new to help live your _own_ remarkable life story. It's a great way to lead into the main events of the WDS weekend and keep the conversations going afterward.
  This short video shows more of what it's all about:

    ## The Details 
Registration for Academies is separate from WDS itself and is available to both WDS attendees (at a discounted rate) and to the general public.

There is no limit to how many Academies you can register for, but please note that you can only purchase Academies for yourself. No physical ticket or confirmation will be required upon check-in, just a valid photo ID. Academy tickets are capacity controlled and offered on a first-come, first-served basis. All tickets are **_non-refundable_** and **_non-transferrable_**.

If you have any questions or need any assistance, please contact our concierge team at **[concierge@wds.fm](mailto:concierge@wds.fm)**.

## The 2018 WDS Academies schedule is coming soon.
