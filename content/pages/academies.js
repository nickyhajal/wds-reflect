    ## At a WDS Academy
    At a WDS Academy, you might learn how to travel hack your way to the dream trip you&apos;ve always wanted to take, discover the science behind happiness, or begin building greater community. Academies are half-day workshops where you can learn something new that will help you to live your *own* remarkable life story. We bring in top experts from the WDS community to share their knowledge and teach practical skills. The line up always includes a variety of topics, from business to personal development to building tiny houses. It's a great way to lead into the main events of the WDS weekend and keep the conversations going after.
