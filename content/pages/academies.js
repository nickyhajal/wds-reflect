    ## WDS Academies
At a WDS Academy, you might learn how to travel hack your way to a life-changing travel experience, master the art of telling compelling stories, or develop a winning branding strategy for your business. 
You'll have the opportunity to learn something new to help live your _own_ remarkable life story. It's a great way to lead into the main events of the WDS weekend and keep the conversations going afterward.
