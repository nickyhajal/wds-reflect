    ## Committed to Change Not By Our Words, But By Our Actions
WDS has always and will always be about creating a better world that we want to see exist. One that is inclusive. One that stands up to injustice. One that promotes equity for all. _But we know that this is not the reality..._

**We want to be very clear that we unequivocally denounce racism, Police brutality, white supremacy, and any discrimination against the Black community.**  

We too demand justice for George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, Ahmaud Arbery, and sadly, so many others. These murders should never have happened and we need systemic change to prevent future deaths. There is no debate. There is no staying silent. Black lives matter.

And speaking of voices we recognize that ours is not the ones we should be hearing from. Our team has been talking about our own privileges and how we are committing ourselves to actively be a part of real change. Here is a page of resources, voices, and organizations we are learning from and actively supporting.

        ## Let's Get to the Root of Racial Injustice - Megan Ming Francis
      
      More than ever, young women need strong role models that show them they can accomplish anything and everything they want. The wider media is catching up, featuring more films with women leading, and the extreme success of the US Women’s World Cup domination inspired countless girls everywhere. But seeing the story of a peer can be just as important, if not more, to empower another. 

This was the catalyst for Laura Peña to create **[She is the Universe: Stories of Girls told by Girls](http://www.sheistheuniverse.org/about-us)**, a global platform dedicated to inspire, empower and support teenage girls from around the globe. Through documenting the stories of 111 teenage girls from 6 continents, of all shapes, sizes, colors, languages, and cultural and socio-economic backgrounds, Laura amplifies the voices of these young women by inspiring and empowering them to stand in their own stories and pursue their dreams, through storytelling, mentorship, and community.

        ## Return of the Birds (Peter Meddick) - 2019

Does reading an intricately detailed description of a sound allow you to hear it on your own or does it inspire you to seek it out to hear for yourself? For Peter Meddick, it was the latter, and his own curiosity to hear the compelling detailed birdsongs described in John Burroughs’ 148-year old text, led him to ornithology collections to listen to the rare bird vocalizations. Through this process, it became clear to Peter that he wanted to bring this story to life through modern audio, creating a work that was not possible when Burroughs published it. 

John Burroughs was a naturalist and nature essayist, and published Wake Robin in 1871. **[Return of the Birds](www.returnofthebirds.com)** offers listeners a joyful escape from busyness, a pleasant quiet place in the rush and noise of contemporary daily life, and reminds us to understand the give and take or nature and humans, and value it. “Long before we could interpret our impact on the earth, Burroughs wrote about the critical relationship between people and the land,” said Meddick. “Birds know no borders or boundaries, yet are a key indicator of the health of our environment.”

Through the Scholarship for Real Life from WDS Foundation, Peter and his family will work with one of the premier Ornithology libraries to access the best recorded bird vocalizations available, and with sound engineers, to produce the serialized audiobook podcast.

        ## A Walk in our Shoes (Yuliya Patsay) - 2019

      Do you know your neighborhood’s history and the cultures that brought it to life? Yuliya Patsay immigrated with her family from the former Soviet Union in 1991. She and her family set down roots in a neighborhood in San Francisco known as “Little Russia,” where the influence of slavic immigrants was present in everything. 

Yuliya also knows there is a strong connection between where we come from to what we bring with us wherever we go - our culture, our language, our food, our energy and passions - and how we impact the community around us. 

As society is increasingly divided and people talk about building walls and closing the path to refugees and immigrants, Yuliya is inspired to share the lasting contributions and impact immigrants have made on their communities, particularly at the micro level. The best way to do this is by allowing people to understand and interact with immigrants by walking in their shoes and seeing the paths they have created for those that come after them.

**[A Walk in Our Shoes](https://www.yuliyapatsay.com/a-walk-in-our-shoes)** is a fully interactive experience that combines both a walking audio tour with a restaurant crawl component through the Richmond neighborhood in San Francisco. Participants will get to learn about the history of the area and buildings, and meet local business owners who have shaped the culture through their food and relationships.

        ## Office Retreat (Keonna Ollison) - 2019
      
      Coworking is becoming a booming trend, and coworking spaces are in abundance to meet the demand. But how many are accessible to marginalized groups, emerging small business owners and creatives? Keonna Ollison believes there are not enough and set out to change that by creating an intentional space dedicated to communities of color and their growth and development. 

Specifically a response to gentrification in historically black neighborhoods of North and Northeast Portland, Keonna aims to restore ethnic pride, prosperity and equity by cultivating ‘Office Retreat,’ a collaborative workspace dedicated to minority entrepreneurs, creatives and other marginalized professionals seeking diverse and safe spaces.

Through Office Retreat, Keonna will create a community that supports people of color and marginalized communities holistically, by developing authentic partnerships with other inclusive nonprofits, hiring POC entrepreneurs and artists to help build Office Retreat, employing POC, LGBTQ, and Women-owned businesses, and holding panel discussion, business networking and culturally relevant events.
