    # Black Lives Matter

#### Committed to Change: Not By Our Words, But By Our Actions
WDS has always and will always be about creating a better world that we want to see exist. One that is inclusive. One that stands up to injustice. One that promotes equity for all. _But we know that this is not the reality..._

**We want to be very clear that we unequivocally denounce racism, police brutality, white supremacy, and any discrimination against the Black community.**  

We too demand justice for George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, Ahmaud Arbery, and sadly, so many others. These murders should never have happened and we need systemic change to prevent future deaths. There is no debate. There is no staying silent. Black lives matter.

And speaking of voices we recognize that ours is not the ones we should be hearing from. Our team has been talking about our own privileges and how we are committing ourselves to actively be a part of real change. Here is a page of resources, voices, and organizations we are learning from and actively supporting.  

_(Please note: This page is a work in progress and we need your help to keep it updated. Please email us at [concierge@wds.fm](mailto:concierge@wds.fm) if there is a voice or resource we should add.)

        ## Let's Get to the Root of Racial Injustice - Megan Ming Francis
      
(from TEDx Talks) In this inspiring and powerful talk, Megan Francis traces the root causes of our current racial climate to their core causes, debunking common misconceptions and calling out "fix-all" cures to a complex social problem.  

Megan Ming Francis is an Assistant Professor in the Department of Political Science at the University of Washington where she specializes in the study of American politics, race, and the development of constitutional law. She is particularly interested in the construction of rights and citizenship, black political activism, and the post-civil war South. Born and raised in Seattle, WA, she was educated at Garfield High School, Rice University in Houston, and Princeton University where she received her M.A. and her Ph.D. in Politics.  

In her award winning book, Civil Rights and the Making of the Modern American State, shows that the battle against lynching and mob violence in the first quarter of the 20th century were pivotal to the development of civil rights and the growth of federal court power. She is inspired by people who fight for justice–even when the end appears nowhere in sight.

**Charles Hunt** knows a thing or two about resilience. At WDS 2017, Charles shared his powerful story and reminded us that society does not dictate who we become because we have more power than we realize—no matter who we are, where we come from, or what our circumstances are, we have the power of choice and the opportunity to become more resilient in the face of adversity.

                                                 With a mantra of “you’re as resilient as you THINK you are”, he helps students, young professionals, business and thought leaders build resilience while harnessing our most important resource in resilience…our minds.

He gave up the use of motorized vehicles and began to walk, because he felt partly responsible for the mess that washed up on the shore. Several months later, on his 27th birthday, because of the arguments his decision to walk seemed to create, John took a vow of silence lasting 17 years.  
During that time, he founded Planetwalk, a non-profit environmental awareness organization, received a B.S. degree from Southern Oregon State College, a Masters degree in Environmental Studies from the University of Montana-Missoula, and a PhD in Land Resources from the Gaylord Nelson Institute for Environmental Studies at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. Ending his silence, John served as project manager for the United States Coast Guard Oil Pollution Act Staff of 1990, in Washington, DC.

        ## Mirna Valerio

Starting off with a beautiful song, Mirna shared with the WDS 2018 audience about stereotypes and embracing multiple identities. She identifies herself as a singer, mother, a teacher, an athlete, and a wife. A medical scare became a catalyst for her to start running, which led to her battle against the limitations and preconceived notions others had about her. Despite this, she recognizes her own biases, realizing how much we all put one another in a box and set limits on what we can and can't do.  
  **Mirna Valerio** is a native of Brooklyn, NY, a former educator, cross-country coach, ultrarunner, obstacle course enthusiast, and author of the recently published memoir, A Beautiful Work in Progress.  
  Although she began running in high school, she recommitted to the sport after a health scare in 2008. It was then that her love for running and all its attendant benefits were reignited. She soon started her blog Fatgirlrunning, about her experiences as a larger woman in a world of thinner athletes.  
  Mirna's athletic story was featured in the _WSJ, Runner’s World_, on the _NBC Nightly News_, _CNN_, on the _CW Network_, and in the viral REI-produced documentary short, The Mirnavator. Her writing has been featured in _Women’s Running Magazine, Self Magazine Online, Outside Online,_ and _Runner's World Magazine_. Most recently, she was chosen as a _2018 National Geographic Adventurer of the Year._

Wouldn’t you want your children to see themselves in the toys they play with? Like many children, Matthew’s kids love jigsaw puzzles. Matthew and his wife struggled with the lack of representative images in commercially-produced products -- with that in mind, they began creating their own puzzle designs featuring African American characters in positive images.

**[Puzzle Huddle](http://www.puzzlehuddle.com/)** develops and produces a line of culturally inclusive images manufactured as puzzles. These puzzles are a tool for adults and children to spend meaningful time together working on an activity that will also affirm the child and stretch their imagination.

Through the Scholarship for Real Life from WDS Foundation, Matthew and his family will work with illustrators to expand the existing product line to include a broader range of ethnic, gender and demographic representation, emphasizing women in leadership positions, and larger-sized puzzles._ magazine and advocate for Women in Adventure Travel. At WDS 2019, Matthew share more of his personal story and the origin of Puzzle Huddle.
