    ## A Look Back at Some of Our Favorite Main-Stage Talks
    At WDS, the community gathers on Saturday and Sunday at the main-stageâ€”this year in the beautiful Newmark Theatre. We'll have community updates, make special memories together, and always a surprise or two for everyone. 
    
    Addtionally, each year we invite several friends of WDS living extraordinary lives and working to build a better world. Our keynote speakers are bestselling authors, leading activists, and in-demand storyteller and they come to WDS to share their stories, experiences, and lessons with our community.

    Here's a look back at some of our favorite keynotes from the last 8 years:
