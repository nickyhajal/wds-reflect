      Submit Your Story
    </h2>
     <p>Do you have a remarkable, personal story that you'd like to share on the WDS main stage? We want to learn more.</p> 

<h3>Your Chance to Propose an Attendee Story</h3>
<p>Community, Adventure and Service are the three core values of WDSâ€”and an Attendee Stories session is your chance to experience all three. The adventure of sharing your story on stage is an awesome way to serve and be a part of this community.</p>

<p>Here are a few ideas of the kind of stories we're looking for:</p>
<ul>
<li>A time in which you needed to trust</li>
<li>A moment that altered the trajectory of your life</li>
<li>A quick lesson or life principle you think would help others</li>
<li>A way in which you were inspired or influenced by someone else, or something that happened</li>
<li>A story that is vulnerable and reflective</li>
<li>A request that you think the WDS community can help you with</li>
<li>A person you'd like to publicly thank</li>
</ul>
