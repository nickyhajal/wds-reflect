    </h2>
<p><h3>Update: We are no longer taking story submissions for WDS 2019. This is just one opportunity to share your story with others so don't stop here.</h3></p> 
     <p>Do you have a remarkable, personal story that you'd like to share on the WDS main stage? We want to learn more.</p> 

<p><h3>Your Chance to Propose an Attendee Story</h3></p>
<p>Community, Adventure and Service are the three core values of WDSâ€”and an Attendee Stories session is your chance to experience all three. The adventure of sharing your story on stage is an awesome way to serve and be a part of this community.</p>

<p>Here are a few ideas of the kind of stories we're looking for:</p>
<p><ul>
<li>A time in which you needed to trust</li>
<li>A moment that altered the trajectory of your life</li>
<li>A quick lesson or life principle you think would help others</li>
<li>A way in which you were inspired or influenced by someone else, or something that happened</li>
<li>A story that is vulnerable and reflective</li>
<li>A request that you think the WDS community can help you with</li>
<li>A person you'd like to publicly thank</li>
</ul></p>
      <p><b>Fill out the following form by Sunday, June 23rd, 5pm PST/8pm EST. (Late submissions will not be considered)</b></p>
