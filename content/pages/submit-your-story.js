      Do You have a Remarkable Story? Share it on The Main stage!
    </h2>
     _Community, Adventure_ and _Service_ are the three core values of WDSâ€”and an Attendee Stories session is your chance to experience all three. The adventure of sharing your story on stage is an awesome way to serve and be a part of this community.

<p>Here are a few ideas of the kind of stories we're looking for:
<ul><li>A time in which you needed to trust</li>
<li>A moment that altered the trajectory of your life</li>
<li>A quick lesson or life principle you think would help others</li>
<li>A way in which you were inspired or influenced by someone else, or something that happened</li>
<li>A story that is vulnerable and reflective</li>
<li>A request that you think the WDS community can help you with</li>
<li>A person you'd like to publicly thank</li></ul></p>

If you'd like to throw your hat into the ring for one of these topics, let us know... and don't delay! **The deadline to be considered is Sunday, June 19th.**
