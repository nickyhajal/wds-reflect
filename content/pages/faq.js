    ### What is WDS?

    The World Domination Summit (WDS) is a gathering of creative, interesting, and remarkable people from all over the world. Every summer, more than one thousand people travel to Portland, Oregon for an immersive experience in life, work, and travel.  
    
    The almost week-long event consists of three primary activities: main-stage events with keynote speakers that are attended by the entire group, workshops that focus on specific topics, and lots of meetups, parties, and informal engagement. Despite the large number of people who attend, WDS is introvert-friendly, and everyone who participates is a big part of the event.  
    
    WDS was founded by **[Chris Guillebeau](http://chrisguillebeau.com)**, explorer of the world and _New York Times_ bestselling author of _The $100 Startup_.
