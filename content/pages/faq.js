    ### What is WDS?

    The World Domination Summit (WDS) is a gathering of creative, interesting, and remarkable people from all over the world. Every summer, more than one thousand people travel to Portland, Oregon for an immersive experience in life, work, and travel.  
    
    The almost week-long event consists of three primary activities: main-stage events with keynote speakers that are attended by the entire group, workshops that focus on specific topics, and lots of meetups, parties, and informal engagement. Despite the large number of people who attend, WDS is introvert-friendly, and everyone who participates is a big part of the event.  
    
    WDS was founded by **[Chris Guillebeau](http://chrisguillebeau.com)**, explorer of the world and _New York Times_ bestselling author of _The $100 Startup_.

   ### When is the next WDS? (IMPORTANT UPDATE) 
      
   **Due to COVID-19, WDS for 2020 has been postponed until June 2021**. For more information go to our **[Postponement page](https://worlddominationsummit.com/postponed)**.

  ### Do you offer a payment plan for tickets?

    ### Can I transfer a WDS ticket to someone else?  

  If you are no longer planning to attend, **the $100 transfer fee has been waived from now until March 31, 2021)**. Note that this waiver applies to the first transfer of a ticket—if another ticketholder wants to transfer their ticket after receiving it from you, they'll need to pay the fee.

    ### Can I nominate myself or someone I represent to be a speaker?  
    
    We're sure that you or your client would be great! ... but we do not accept nominations for speakers. Everyone who attends WDS is a big part of everything. Current year speakers are nominated by alumni speakers from previous years.

    ### Can I sponsor WDS or donate something for your attendees?  
    
    WDS is a sponsor-free, non-commercial gathering. We do not accept advertising or sponsored products.

    ### Can I be a volunteer?  
    
    Every year we recruit a number of volunteer "Ambassadors" to serve our attendees during WDS. To apply for this role, you must be a champion in helping attendees have an amazing experience, have extensive knowledge of Portland, and be available during the entire weekend for WDS main-events. Special consideration is given to those that are available for the entire week of WDS. Applications are typically available 3-4 months prior to WDS. Email our team at **[concierge@wds.fm](mailto:concierge@wds.fm)** to get notified when applications become available.
