    ### What is WDS?

    The World Domination Summit (WDS) is a gathering of creative, interesting people from all over the world. Every summer, 1000+ of people travel to Portland, Oregon for an immersive experience in life, work, and travel.
    The almost week-long event consists of three primary activities: main-stage events with keynote speakers that are attended by the entire group, workshops that focus on specific topics, and lots of meetups, parties, and informal engagement. Despite the large number of people who attend, WDS is introvert-friendly, and everyone who participates is a big part of the event.
    <p>WDS was founded by <Link to="http://chrisguillebeau.com" target="blank">Chris Guillebeau</Link>, explorer of the world and <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author of <i>The $100 Startup</i>.</p>

   ### When is the next WDS? 
      
   WDS 2019 will take place from June 25th until July 1st, 2019. The main events takes place over the WDS weekend, June 28th to June 30th.
