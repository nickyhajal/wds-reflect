      Join Us for WDS Day - June 27, 2020
    </h2>
Greetings from WDS HQ! I hope you're staying safe and sane during these strange times.

This is the time of year when the team usually kick things into a higher gear to prepare for everyone's arrival in Portland. This time, though, we've been confined to a series of virtual meetings as a team, and Zoom check-ins with our 2020 attendees.

In case you missed it, we decided a while back that WDS 2020 (our intended finale) will now take place one year later, in the summer of 2021.

Though we're sad that we won't be meeting for WDS this year, we're excited to announce the start of something new that will outlive WDS itself... **WDS Day!**

<h2>What is WDS Day</h2>   

Every year on the last Saturday of June, members of the community will commit to doing an activity that honors the WDS core values of Community, Adventure, and Service.

This could mean volunteering at a local food pantry, getting your first tattoo, going on that hike you've always wanted to, learning a new recipe, checking in with an old friend (or making a new one), etc... We'll then share those activities online through social media using #WDSlocal.

Prior to the pandemic, we were already having discussions as a community about how WDS can live on (independent of the main event) after our final year. We know that the best part about WDS is the people and not the event itself!

Additional examples ideas include (especially with our current global situation in mind):
- Learning to cook/bake something new
- Connecting with a long lost friend
- Doing something to thank essential workers
- Hosting an online dance party
- Taking part in a virtual tour or activity (like a museum or one of the 7 wonders of the world)
- Learning a new language
- Create and send a care package
- Going on a hike or exploring a neighborhood (if it's safe to do so)
                                               
After hearing feedback from this community and discussing it as a team, we know that the best part about WDS is the people who make up this community and not the event itself. We know WDS will continue to live on through everyone that has taken part in it. Though we had planned to launch WDS Day this year at WDS, the current times give us a great opportunity to live out our WDS values, today.  
                                               _*Special for this year, we'll also be hosting a limited number of virtual, attendee-led meetups._

**What is the Schedule/Plan for This Year's WDS Day?** 
First, save the date for this year's WDS Day: **Saturday, June 27, 2020**

On this day we'll do 3 things as a community:  

1) **Gather together and meet online as a community**: think of this as a virtual WDS main stage. We'll have light programming, but more importantly, it will be a time that we can collectively gather together. A Zoom meeting link will be emailed to all interested participants.
2) **Take part in an activity that honors the WDS core values**: what is one thing you could do in honor of WDS?  
3) **Join/Host an Attendee-led, virtual meetup**: one of the cornerstones of any WDS is our attendee-led meetups. Members of the WDS community will host smaller get-togethers centered around different topics.

**How Do I Paricipate in WDS Day?**  
WDS Day is open to the entire WDS community. To make sure you get all the event information and updates, please sign up with your email at **[this link](http://madmimi.com/signups/37b1184441c943a0a93ac294552aa549/join)**. 
  
  **Please note: a WDS Account is required to RSVP for meetups.** All information about the event will be communicated via email and also posted on this page.
