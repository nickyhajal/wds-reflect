      Join Us for WDS Day - June 27, 2020
    </h2>
Greetings from WDS HQ! I hope you're staying safe during these unprecendented times.

This is the time of year when the team usually kick things into a higher gear to prepare for everyone's arrival in Portland. This time, though, we've been confined to a series of virtual meetings as a team, and Zoom check-ins with our 2020 attendees.

In case you missed it, [we announced in April](https://worlddominationsummit.com/postponed) that WDS 2020 (our intended finale) will now take place one year later, in the summer of 2021.

Though we're sad that we won't be meeting in-person for WDS this year, we're excited to announce the start of something new that will outlive WDS itself... **WDS Day!**

## What is WDS Day?

Every year on the last Saturday of June, members of the community will commit to doing an activity that honors the WDS core values of **Community**, **Adventure**, and **Service**.

This could mean volunteering at a local food pantry, getting your first tattoo, going on that hike you've always looked at, or even just checking in with an old friend. We'll then share those activities online through social media using **#WDSlocal**.

Prior to the global pandemic, we were already having discussions as a community about how WDS can live on (independent of the main event) after our final year. We know that the best part about WDS is the people and not the event itself!

Additional ideas include:
- Connecting with a long lost friend
- Doing something to thank essential workers
- Reading a book or taking a workshop on anti-racism
- Hosting an online dance party
- Learning to cook or bake something new
- Creating and sending a care package
- Going on a hike or exploring a neighborhood (depending on local conditions, of course).

These are just a few ideas to get you thinking. We're excited to see what you come up with. Don't forget to share your chosen activity during WDS Day with **#WDSlocal**.

## Virtual Attendee-Led Meetups                                               
And because we won't be meeting in person this year, we're putting a call out for Virtual Attendee-led Meetups. Meetups will take place from 10:00am Saturday the 27th through all-day Sunday the 28th.  

Here are two important links to for those interested in hosting a meetup:

## What's The Plan For This Year's WDS Day?  
                                         
First, save the date for this year's WDS Day: **Saturday, June 27, 2020** 
                                         We'll start this year's WDS Day by coming together and meeting online as a community (through Zoom) **starting at 9:00am PT**.  
From there the community will take part in individual activities that reflect the WDS core values and participate in Attendee-led, virtual meetups. We'll then **finish the day together at 6:00pm PT**.
