    ## Greetings Extraordinary Leaders! 
    <p>We're thrilled to invite you to join us at the 8th annual <i>World Domination Summit</i> taking place June 26th - July 2nd in Portland. Best of all, we want you to attend as our honored guest (at no charge) as part of our <b>League of Leaders</b> program.</p>

<p>Since 2011, WDS has brought together more than 10,000 people from over forty countries together around the core values of <b>community, adventure, and service</b> to discuss this central question, <i>"how can we live a remarkable life in a conventional world"</i>.</p>

#### WDS + Portland + You!
We love that people travel great distances to be here, but we also know that Portland (and our surrounding communities) boast some incredibly talented world-changers. Our goal is to give you the opportunity to meet with other folks who are doing amazing things from around the country and the world, and give them the opportunity to meet you.

We've seen the power of bringing together remarkable people together, and we want to give local leaders like you the chance to think through your challenges in an unconventional way, to brainstorm new ideas for solving issues youâ€™re working on, and to meet new allies and partners that may be able to help you along your way. We're also looking forward to the great experience, knowledge, and stories you can bring to our community. That's what makes WDS an event unlike any other. It's a gathering of amazing individuals who learn from each other and then take what we've learned to make a postive imapact in our local communities, and ultimately, our world.
