      Back in 2011, we invited 440 remarkable adventurers to Portland, Oregon for a two-day event we called the World Domination Summit. Our common curiosity brought us together to explore one central question: *How do we live a remarkable life in a conventional world?* 
        
        Seven years later, WDS is an annual gathering that brings 1000+ attendees from 30+ countries to learn, get inspired, think outside of the box, break out of what’s holding them back, and most importantly- connect. Armed with an incredible community of over 10,000 alumni, our quest continues to find more remarkable people. 
      
      Are you one of them?
        
       Join us for **WDS Connect** -- a collection of activities during WDS week that allows you to sample the spirit of WDS and meet other amazing adventurers. While WDS 360 is the all-access pass, Connect is a social, interactive part of the WDS experience.
   
      <p>Connect tickets cost <b>$179</b> and are <i>non-refundable and non-transferrable.</i></p>

        <Block className="bigger" width="100%" margin="30px 0 0 0" css={{ textAlign: 'left' }}>You might have some questions. We've got some answers.</Block>
        ### What's the difference between 360 and Connect tickets? 
        WDS 360 is an all-access pass that includes the Connect experience and all main-stage events (a special adventure on Friday morning, 360 opening kickoff, and all theatre sessions on Saturday and Sunday). Connect is an important part of WDS, but is not the full experience.   
        ### When does WDS Connect take place?
        WDS Connect takes place starting from *Tuesday, June 26 until Monday, July 2*. Using the mobile app, you'll be able to create your own personalized schedule of events and activities that you want to participate in (except for 360 designated events).
       
        ### Can I buy more than one Connect ticket?
        Yes! You can purchase up to three tickets per transaction. Please note you will need to assign each ticket by submitting a unique name and email for each ticket at the time of purchase.  
        ### Can I Upgrade my Connect ticket to a 360 ticket?
        <p>Yes! As long as we still have 360 tickets available, you can upgrade your ticket by paying the difference. Contact our concierge team at <b>concierge@wds.fm</b> and they’ll walk you through the process.</p>
