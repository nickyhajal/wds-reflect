    _How do we live a remarkable life in a conventional world?_

For 8 years and counting, this question has guided our pursuit of Community, Adventure, and Service at an annual event that takes place each summer in Portland, Oregon. 

It all started when author and traveler **Chris Guillebeau** was on a book tour to all 50 states. At each stop, he met more and more interesting people. Many of them felt isolated and unsupported in their goals and dreams. Hoping to connect these people with one another, we invited 440 of them to our first “World Domination Summit” (WDS) in 2011. 
      
Fast forward to 2018, and we’re still exploring the question every summer with an in-person gathering that has now included more than 10,000 people from more than 40 countries. The stakes and stories have grown each year with activities like hundreds of meetups and dozens of half-day workshops, Guinness World Records, Bollywood dancing, and more. 

Profits from WDS go to a foundation that offers microgrants to individuals who positively impact their community. We call them “Scholarships for Real Life.”
    
      __All that's missing is *you*!__

      Join us for WDS Connect, a collection of events during WDS week that allows you to sample the spirit of WDS and meet other amazing adventurers. Whether you've been to WDS before or are completely new to the experience, WDS Connect is the perfect pathway to our shared adventure.

        ## WDS Connect™ FAQs
        <Block className="bigger" width="100%" margin="30px 0 0 0" css={{ textAlign: 'left' }}>You might have some questions. We've got some answers.</Block>
        ### What's the difference between 360 and Connect tickets? 
        WDS 360 is an all-access pass that includes the Connect experience and all main-stage events (a special adventure on Friday morning, 360 opening kickoff, and all theatre sessions on Saturday and Sunday). Connect is an important part of WDS, but is not the full experience.   
        ### When does WDS Connect take place?
        WDS Connect takes place starting from *Tuesday, June 26 until Monday, July 2*. Using the mobile app, you'll be able to create your own personalized schedule of events and activities that you want to participate in (except for 360 designated events).
       
        ### Can I buy more than one Connect ticket?
        Yes! However, you can only purchase one Connect ticket per transaction. If you'd like to purchase an additional Connect ticket you'll need to go through the purchase process again and assign the ticket to the new person. If you encounter any difficulty, make sure you're logged out. 
        ### Can I Upgrade my Connect ticket to a 360 ticket?
        <p>Yes! As long as we still have 360 tickets available, you can upgrade your ticket by paying the difference. Contact our concierge team at <b>concierge@wds.fm</b> and they’ll walk you through the process.</p>
        ### Not finding the answer to your question?
