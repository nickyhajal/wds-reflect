   <p style={{textAlign: 'center'}}><h4 style={{ marginBottom: '4px' }}>June 26 - July 2, 2018 in Portland, Oregon</h4></p>
      Back in 2011, we invited 500 adventurers to Portland, Oregon for a two-day event we called the World Domination Summit. Our common curiosity brought us together to explore one central question: _How do we live a remarkable life in a conventional world?_
      
      Seven years later, WDS is an annual gathering that brings over 1000+ attendees from over 30+ countries to learn, get inspired, think outside of the box, do fun adventerous things together (even if it makes us stretch) and most importantly, build lasting and impactful relationships -- to connect with one another. Armed with an incredible community of over 10,000 alumni, our quest continues to find more remarkable people.

      All that's missing is *you*!

      Join us for WDS Connect, a collection of events during WDS week that allows you to sample the spirit of WDS and meet other amazing adventurers. Whether you've been to WDS before or heard about the event but not quite ready for the whole shebang, WDS 360 is the whole pizza whereas Connect is a giant slice of the experience.  
      
      <p style={{textAlign: 'center'}}>Connect tickets cost <b>$179</b> and are non-refundable and non-transferrable.</p>

        ## Connect™ FAQs
        <Block className="bigger" width="100%" margin="30px 0 0 0" css={{ textAlign: 'left' }}>You might have some questions. We've got some answers.</Block>
        ### What is the difference between 360 and Connect tickets? 
        WDS 360 is an all-access pass that includes the Connect experience and main-events (the big adventure, 360 opening party, and all main stage sessions). Connect is a huge part of the WDS but is not the full experience.   
        ### When does WDS Connect take place?
        WDS Connect takes place starting from Tuesday, June 26 until Monday, July 2. Using the mobile-app you'll be able to create your own personalized schedule of events and activities that you want to participate in (except for 360 designated events).
        ### What is your refund/transfer policy for WDS Connect Tickets?
        <p>All Connect tickets are <b>non-refundable</b> and <b>non-transferrable.</b></p>  
        ### Can I buy more than one Connect ticket?
        Yes - well sort of. You can only purchase 1 Connect ticket per transaction. If you'd like to purchase an additional Connect ticket you'll need to go through the purchase process again and assign the ticket to the new person.
        ### Can I Updgrade my Connect ticket to a 360 ticket?
        <p>Yes! As long as we still have 360 tickets available you can upgrade your ticket by paying the difference. Contact our concierge team at <b>concierge@wds.fm</b> and they’ll walk you through the process.</p>
        ### Not finding the answer to your question?
