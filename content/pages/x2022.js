      WDS X - The Final Chapter Slated for June 2022
    </h2>
    
    Dear WDS Community,  
    
    Greetings from WDS HQ where we have been patiently waiting, washing our hands regularly, and anticipating the day we can welcome you back to Portland for our final WDS. We miss _you_!!!
    
   I'm writing today with an important announcement -- **WDS is Postponed (again), Not _Canceled_**

   We remain committed to hosting a final WDS. This event is important to all of us, and the entire core team is dedicated to seeing it through. 

Before this happened, we were working on some big plans for the event … and those plans will still take place, just not right away. 

## New Dates for WDS

**We've already confirmed the following dates for 2022**:

- **WDS Week:** Tuesday, June 21 through Sunday, June 26
- **Main Events:** Thursday, June 24 to Sunday, June 27  

This was not an easy decision. Why? Because we want to see you all and gather as a community as soon as possible. Like you, we've been monitoring the global situation and there is light at the end of this pandemic tunnel. We've been closely monitoring our local and state guidelines and working with our local venues to determine when we can safely host WDS at its full capacity and decided that 2022 would be best.

Here's some important factors we considered when making this decision: 

-- While many people are getting vaccinated (yay!), there are still a lot of folks that don't have access to a vaccine yet. Waiting another year allows more people the opportunity to get vaccinated. Our community's safety will always be the most important priority to us.

-- We are committed to hosting a final WDS at the level and capacity we have always put on WDS. We don't feel the world is at a point where things are "back to normal" making it challenging to honor this committement.

-- Travel has been greatly reduced during the pandemic and additionally, there were travel restrictions that prevented people from coming to the US. We anticipate that both of these will change in the coming year. We want to make sure as many friends from around the world can participate in WDS who would like to do so.

    ## FAQs About WDS Postponement

    ## Ticket Information. 

    ##### I have a ticket for the final WDS, am I still registered?  
    
    YES, your ticket has already been rolled over to next year's event. No further action is needed.
    ##### Is WDS still sold out? How can I get a ticket?
    
  YES, WDS is still sold out. While a lot of things are still up in the air and out of our control, at this point we don't plan to sell any more tickets.

    There might be a ticket available from someone that can no longer attend. Please contact our concierge team at **[concierge@wds.fm](mailto:concierge@wds.fm), and they'll do their best to connect you with someone.
    
    ##### If I won't be able to attend next year, can I transfer my ticket?
    
   YES, and we are making this process more flexible. If you are no longer planning to attend, **the $100 transfer fee has been waived from now until the end of this year (December 31, 2021)**. Note that this waiver applies to the first transfer of a ticket—if another ticketholder wants to transfer their ticket after receiving it from you, they'll need to pay the fee. 
                                                       
    ##### How do I transfer my ticket?  
    
   Contact our Concierge team at **[concierge@wds.fm](mailto:concierge@wds.fm)** and provide the name, email, and mailing address of the person you’re transferring your ticket to. Starting January 1, 2022, a $100 transfer fee will be required to complete the process. **The last day to complete all transfers is May 12, 2022** (40 days prior to WDS).

   ## See you next year!
   
   We're still sad WDS is not happening, but the good news is that it will continue for another year.  _Hang in there!_
