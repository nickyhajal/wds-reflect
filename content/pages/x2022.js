      WDS X Will Be Held in June 2022
    </h2>
    
    Dear WDS Community,  
    
   Well ... we really hoped it would work for this year, but late June seems a bit too optimistic for an epic WDS.

Therefore, in coordination with the city of Portland and other partners, we're going to postpone the event once more to the same week one year later, June 21-26, 2022. More details are listed below. 

## New Dates for WDS

**We've already confirmed the following dates for 2022**:

- **WDS Week:** Tuesday, June 21 through Sunday, June 26
- **Main Events:** Thursday, June 24 to Sunday, June 27

  ## Important: We Shall Return! 
    
    We remain committed to hosting WDS again. This event is important to all of us, and the core team is dedicated to seeing it through.  
    
    Before the pandemic took over our lives, we were working on some big plans for the event. Those plans will still take place as soon as circumstances permit.

    ## FAQs About WDS Postponement    

    ##### Where will WDS take place?  
    
WDS will remain in Portland, Oregon and in many of the same venues we were planning on using. The city of Portland has always been the home of WDS and will continue to be for the 2022 event.
    
    ##### I have a ticket for WDS 2020, am I still registered for WDS x?  
    
    YES, your original ticket has already been rolled over to next year's event, which we're now calling WDS X. No further action is needed.

    ##### Is WDS still sold out? How can I get a ticket?
    
  YES, WDS is still sold out. While a lot of things are still up in the air and out of our control, at this point we don't plan to sell any more tickets.

    There might be a ticket available from someone that can no longer attend. Please contact our concierge team at [concierge@wds.fm](mailto:concierge@wds.fm), and they'll do their best to connect you with someone.
    
    ##### If I won't be able to attend next year, can I transfer my ticket?
    
   YES, and we are making this process more flexible. If you are no longer planning to attend, **the $100 transfer fee has been waived from now until the end of this year (December 31, 2021)**. Note that this waiver applies to the first transfer of a ticket—if another ticketholder wants to transfer their ticket after receiving it from you, they'll need to pay the fee. 
                                                       
    ##### How do I transfer my ticket?  
    
   Contact our Concierge team at **[concierge@wds.fm](mailto:concierge@wds.fm)** and provide the name, email, and mailing address of the person you’re transferring your ticket to. Starting January 1, 2022, a $100 transfer fee will be required to complete the process. **The last day to complete all transfers is May 12, 2022** (40 days prior to WDS).  
                            
    ## I have more questions...  
    
    Contact our year-round concierge team at **[concierge@wds.fm](mailto:concierge@wds.fm)** and they'll do their best to assist you.

   ## See you next year!
   
   We're still sad WDS is not happening, but the good news is that it will continue for at least another year.  _Hang in there!_  
    
    Yours in slightly delayed world domination,
