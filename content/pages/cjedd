        ## Shaun King - WDS Speaker 2017

       <p>Shaun King is a journalist, a humanitarian, an activist, and the Senior Justice Writer for the <i>New York Daily News</i>. Today, there are crucial conversations rippling across North America—conversations happening on social media, on campuses, in the streets and around dinner tables. In greater numbers, people are talking about real empowerment and liberation for historically disadvantaged groups.</p>

<p>When it comes to the Black Lives Matter movement, they’re talking specifically about human dignity for African Americans. And for this movement, Shaun is amongst the most compelling voices: a humane and passionate advocate for justice and families, and an extremely visible fundraiser for victims of brutality and discrimination. His latest project is the <Link to="http://www.injusticeboycott.com/">Injustice Boycott.</Link></p>

        ## Ryan Banks Academy - 2016

        School teachers in urban districts face special challenges in promoting their students’ long-term academic success. It is no surprise that so-called “failing” schools are disproportionately situated in urban centers with high rates of poverty and crime. Valerie Groth is a mission to change that for Chicago-area students. In 2014, she founded Ryan Banks Academy, a coeducational boarding school that seeks to impact the lives of students through a rigorous college and career preparatory education, a supportive boarding program, and a focus on personal development in a positive environment. The goal of Ryan Banks Academy is to teach students not only the value of education, but also encourage them to focus on cultivating their own unique strengths, interests, and passions so that they may lead a purpose-filled life. Curriculum focuses not only on academic pursuits, but also on developing their relationships, core values, and mindset.

<p>There are many steps in her journey to build the school, and the Scholarship for Real Life grant will be helping get her fundraising efforts of the ground, as well as help support her burgeoning volunteer program. She is currently looking for assistance with grant writing and donor outreach, as well as anyone with a background in curriculum development.

        ## SnapType - 2016

        SnapType breaks down the barriers to education and helps students survive in a school system that wasn’t designed for them. The app enables students to complete any school worksheet on an iPad.

An estimated 1 in 5 people have difficulty expressing themselves through writing. For students, that can lead to falling behind in class, emotional problems at home, low self-esteem, and a sense of hopelessness. When Amberlynn Slavin was doing her fieldwork as an occupational therapy graduate student, she worked with a child who had dysgraphia - a learning disability that makes handwriting incredibly messy.

Together with her husband, Ben Slavin, they created an app to take a picture of a worksheet and then simply type the answers in on the screen. Feedback from the community has been extremely positive! The challenge they face now is that there are 4 times as many Android devices used around the world than there are Apple. To make SnapType work on Android, they have to re-write the app from the ground up in a completely different programming language.

A WDS Foundation scholarship was granted to help fund the development of SnapType for Android. Soon, students around the world will be given the chance to have more independence, self confidence and the opportunity to keep up with their peers!
