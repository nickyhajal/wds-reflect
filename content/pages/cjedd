    ## Introducing the WDS Hotel™
    Community has always been at the heart of WDS. Every year, many attendees forge lasting friendships and find creative ways to stay together during the weekend before they return home. 
    
    <p>One of the most frequent requests we receive is a way to centralize the process of group accommodations. Well, we can’t be a matchmaker… but we have reserved <i>an entire hotel</i> for the final four days of WDS 2017.</p>
    
    <p>This hotel, known during non-WDS times as the <Link to="http://thesocietyhotel.com/">Society Hotel</Link>, consists of one large room with shared bunks (hostel style, but nice) <i>and</i> a number of private rooms, including suites. Want to be the life of the party? Book a bunk. Need your space? Choose one of the rooms or suites.</p>
    
    <p>If you love the community of WDS, you’ll love the WDS Hotel™. It’s a sleepover party with 100 of your closest friends.</p>

      ## WDS Hotel™ FAQs
    You might have some questions. We've got some answers.
   ##### Can I book a WDS Hotel™ package through the Society Hotel? 
   Because of our arrangement with the Society Hotel, WDS is handling reservations for all rooms during the WDS weekend (arriving Thursday, July 13, checking out Monday, July 17). All rooms will be sold as 4-night packages.   
   ##### What is your refund/transfer policy for WDS Hotel™ packages?
    <p>All WDS Hotel packages are <b>non-refundable</b>. You can, however, transfer your package to another attendee for a $50 fee until June 10th by contacting the WDS concierge team (not the Society Hotel) at <b>concierge@wds.fm</b>.</p>  
    ##### How do I book additional nights before or after the WDS package dates?
    <p>Once you've reserved your WDS Hotel™ package, please contact the Society Hotel by phone (avoid their online reservation system) to set up any additional dates by calling their front desk at <b>503-445-0444</b>. You may be able to stay in the same room type as your WDS Hotel™ package, but that will depend on the hotel's room availability.</p>
    ##### When will my credit card be charged?
     Your card will be immediately charged for the full amount when you book a WDS Hotel™ package. You'll also need to provide a credit card upon check in for an incidental hold. This will also allow you to charge any hotel services, like buying a coffee or cocktail, directly to your room.
     ##### Can I book a room with another WDS attendee?
     <p>Yes! Similar to any hotel reservation, one person is responsible for the reservation itself and only that person will be able to make any changes. <i>Bunks require individual reservations.</i></p>
     ##### Can I book a partial stay or split days with a friend?
     Once you've booked a package, you get the room or bunk for the entire 4 nights regardless of how many days you plan to use. Like any hotel reservation, you are ultimately responsible for any other guests that you let stay in your room. For example, if your friend charges 20 craft microbrews to the room, you'd be responsible for paying the bill.
     ##### Can I book a private room with another person who isn’t attending WDS?
    <p>We'd love for everyone staying at the WDS Hotel™ to be part of WDS. However, we understand if you’ve booked a private room and you have a significant other or dependent staying with you who is not attending WDS. <i>For the bunk section of the hotel, all guests need to be registered WDS attendees.</i></p>
    ##### What kinds of facilities are in the hotel?
   There is an excellent cafe that serves light fare for breakfast and lunch, which you'll be able to charge to your room. Additionally, as a registered guest you'll have access to the amazing rooftop lounge. Please note there is not a fitness center onsite.    
   ##### How do I get to the hotel from the airport? 
   <p>For just $2.50, you can take the MAX red line train from the airport towards "City Center/Beaverton" and get off at the "Old Town/Chinatown" stop. Walk two blocks west on Davis St. and you'll see the hotel at the corner of Davis and 3rd Ave. <Link to="https://goo.gl/maps/93LythVvQEG2">(Google directions).</Link> Taxis and ride share options are also available.</p>
   ##### How far is the hotel from the WDS Main Stage?
    <p>The hotel is less than a mile (0.8) walk through downtown <Link to="https://goo.gl/maps/TTdw8Ae8xGu">(Google directions)</Link>. You can also make the trip by bike, light rail (MAX) system, or ride share.</p>
    ##### Not finding the answer to your question?
    <p>Contact our year-round concierge team at <b>concierge@wds.fm</b>. They’ll get back to you at lightning speed!</p>
