      Make WDS Awesome! Propose a Meetup.
    </h2>
    The goal of WDS has always been to bring amazing people together who believe in and live out the core values of Community, Adventure, and Service.  For the past 9 years, attendee-led meetups have been an integral part of the WDS experience and the best way for us as a community to learn from each other.
    {' '}

    Here are the goals of meetups:

    <table className="time-table">
      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <td>Help each other in our pursuits to live remarkable lives</td>
        </tr>
        <tr><td>Learn and discover</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Make new connections within the WDS community</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Do something fun and memorable together</td></tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>

    As an WDS community member, you have the opportunity to host meetups, attend meetups, or do both using our online system.

    ## When Should I Host a Meetup?
    For WDS Day (June 27th) We'll come together and meet online as a community at 9:00am and 6:00pm Pacific. Meetups should take place around these gatherings (all times listed below are for Pacific Standard Time):

    <table className="time-table">
      <tbody>
        <tr><td>Saturday, June 27th</td><td>10:00am - 5:55pm, anytime after 7:00pm.</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Sunday, June 28th</td><td>Anytime until 8:00pm </td></tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>
