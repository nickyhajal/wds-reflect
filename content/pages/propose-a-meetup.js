      Make WDS Awesome! Propose a Meetup.
    </h2>
    The goal of WDS has always been to bring amazing people together who believe in and live out the core values of Community, Adventure, and Service.  For the past 9 years, attendee-led meetups have been an integral part of the WDS experience and the best way for us as a community to learn from each other.
    {' '}

    Here are the goals of meetups:

    <table className="time-table">
      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <td>Help each other in our pursuits to live remarkable lives</td>
        </tr>
        <tr><td>Learn and discover</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Make new connections within the WDS community</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Do something fun and memorable together</td></tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>

    As a WDS attendee, you have the opportunity to host meetups, attend meetups, or do both using our online system and the WDS mobile app.

    ## When Should I Host a Meetup?
    Here is a list of the best times to host an attendee meet up that doesn't conflict with main WDS programming (parties, world record attempt, and main stage sessions). These are the most optimal times for your fellow attendees to take part in meetups. Please note this does not include Academies or WDS HQ programming.

    <table className="time-table">
      <tbody>
      <tr><td>Tuesday, June 21</td><td>Any time</td></tr>
      <tr><td>Wednesday, June 22</td><td>Any time</td></tr>
      <tr><td>Thursday, June 23</td><td>Any time</td></tr>
      <tr><td>Friday, June 24</td><td>Between 11:00am and 6:00pm</td></tr>  
      <tr><td>Saturday, June 25</td><td>Before 8:00am, 1:00pm - 4:00pm, and anytime after 7:00pm</td></tr>
      <tr><td>Sunday, June 26</td><td>Before 8:00am, 1:00pm - 4:00pm </td></tr>
      <tr><td>Monday, June 27</td><td>Any time</td></tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>

    ## How to Host a Meetup
    Want to host a meetup at WDS X, hereâ€™s what you need to do:

    <div style={{ padding: '0 32px' }}>
      <p>
        1. Before you propose a meetup, use the information from the following PDF guide to help you organize a successful event: <a href="https://el-files-wds.s3.amazonaws.com/docs/WDS+X+-+Meetup+Guide.pdf" target="_blank">WDS Meetup Guidelines - Create the Best Meetup Ever!!!</a> 
      </p>
      <p>
        (Helpful hint: The chances of your meetup getting approved goes up <i><b>astronomically</b></i> if you read and use this document)
      </p>
    </div>
    <div style={{ padding: '0 32px' }}>
      <p>
        2. Complete the form below with the details on what you have planned. We'll review your proposal and get back to you to let you know if your meetup was confirmed or not. If your meetup isn't approved, we'll get in touch with you to assist you.
      </p>
    </div>
    Once your proposal is accepted, it will be listed in our official directory of WDS meetups and made available to all registered WDS attendees.
    {' '}

    ## Meetup Proposal Form
    {' '}
    Use the form below to tell us about your awesome event. **For the best experience, please submit your information using a computer or tablet.**
    {' '}
    **Please note that if your meetup is approved, we will use the information from this form to display your meetup in our system (unless otherwise noted).**
