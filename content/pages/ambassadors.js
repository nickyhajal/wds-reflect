### What is an Ambassador? 

Ambassadors are our all-volunteer team of amazing humans who help make WDS happen each year. Ambassadors do a variety of tasks that make WDS run smoothly including: 

- Running registration
- Handing out swag
- Creating an amazing experience at our opening and closing parties 
- Assisting with our big adventure
- Answering questions, giving directions, and providing assistance
- And much more!
