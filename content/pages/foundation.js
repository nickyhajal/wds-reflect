    ## WDS Foundation 
  Launched with an initial funding gift at the end of WDS 2013, the World Domination Summit Foundation has put resources in the hands of amazing people who are acting on the three core values of WDS -- community, adventure, and service -- by providing individual grants called 'Scholarships for Real Life.'  

The goal of these grants has been to empower WDS attendees to pursue their dreams and impact their community, and WDS Foundation has granted over $200,000 to fund 21 incredible projects over the course of six years.  

The Foundation and the Scholarships For Real Life program has come to an end, but it has been an honor to support these projects and dreams, and to witness many blossom and grow with the help of our initial funding.
