    Dear WDS Community,  
    
    Greetings from WDS HQ! I wanted to bring you this important update as soon as we had the information.   
    
    As our team has continued to monitor the global pandemic we all know as COVID-19, we've come to the decision to **postpone the final WDS until the summer of 2021**. This wasn't an easy decision, but we also don't have much of an alternative given the ever-changing situation.  
    
    We want to make sure that when we gather again to celebrate (and we _will_ gather again), we'll do so under the best possible circumstances. Watch the video below to learn more about the thought process behind the decision.

    ## Important: WDS is Not Canceled. 
    
    We remain committed to hosting a final WDS. This event is important to all of us, and the entire core team is dedicated to seeing it through.  
    
    Before this happened, we were working on some big plans for the event … and those plans will still take place, just not right away.

    ## Ticket Information  
    
    ##### What happens to my ticket now that the summit is postponed for a year?  
    
    Your ticket has already been rolled over to next year's event. No further action is needed here.  

    ##### Is WDS still sold out? 
    
    Yes, WDS is still sold out. We will not be releasing more tickets.  
    
    ##### Can I get a refund for my ticket?
    
    WDS tickets are non-refundable and have been since year one. If you are not planning to attend, you can transfer your ticket to someone else. The $100 transfer fee has been waived from now until the end of this year, 2020.  
                                                       
    ##### How do I transfer my ticket?  
    
    Go to [wds.fm/transfer](https://worlddominationsummit.com/transfer) and login. You’ll then be asked to provide a name, email, and mailing address of the person you’re transferring your ticket to. Starting January 1, 2021, a $100 transfer fee will be required to complete the process. The last day to transfer a WDS ticket is May 12, 2021 (40 days prior to WDS). 

    ## Hotel Questions  
    
    ##### What happens to my WDS Hotel package that I purchased for this year?  
                            
    That reservation has been cancelled by the hotel and any charges will be refunded within 1-2 weeks.  
    
    ##### What if I booked accomodations through an official hotel partner (Paramount & Hotel Zags)?  
    
    Please contact our hotel partners directly to cancel your reservations.
