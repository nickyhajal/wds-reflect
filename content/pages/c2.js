    ## How the WDS Schedule Works
    As we've done since year one, the main events (main-stage keynotes and celebrations) take place during the weekend of WDS. Additionally, every attendee will have the ability to add events and activities throughout the entire week using the WDS mobile app to create their own personalized schedule. You decide if you'll join us for the weekend or come for the entire week. Regardless, a [WDS ticket](https://worlddominationsummit.com/join-us) gives you access to it all; the main events plus special discounts, bonuses, and surprises.
