Tania encouraged the WDS 2020 audience to ‘creatively trespass’. Tania shared how she spent her entire career bringing creativity into less overtly creative spaces. From working in corporate settings to working with corporate leaders, Tania has been challenging the conventional thought that there’s only rigid and formal ways to achieve goals and objectives. She encouraged the community to discover what limiting belief is holding us back from the creative leap we’ve been longing to take.
