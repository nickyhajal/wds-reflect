At WDS X, Karla talked about the Self Help Industrial Complex – where privileged experts who have been at the top of their game are removed from the reality of their readers. She shared that we’re drawn to simple answers and yet “there is no one neat trick to become your best self.” People mistake data for the whole truth, but there are always complex factors to take into consideration.
