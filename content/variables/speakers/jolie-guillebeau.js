In her 2017 keynote, Jolie challenged the WDS community not to turn away from injustices, even though they're shameful and it's easier to do so. She encouraged the community to use our eyes, our heads, our voice, and our heart to be aware of what is going on around us and do something about it. Jolie reminded us that being kind is not enough—we need to have empathy for our fellow humans in order to make positive social change.
