**Gretchen Rubin** is the author of the blockbuster New York Times bestsellers, *Happier at Home* and *The Happiness Project*, accounts of her experiences test-driving the wisdom of the ages, current scientific studies, and lessons from popular culture about how to be happier.

On her popular blog, The Happiness Project (happiness-project.com), she reports on her daily adventures in pursuit of happiness. Rubin is an enthusiastic proponent of using technology to engage with readers about ideas, and she has a wide, active following on social media. “The Happiness Project” was even an answer on the game-show Jeopardy!

A graduate of Yale and Yale Law School, Rubin started her career in law, and was clerking for Justice Sandra Day O’Connor when she realized she wanted to be a writer. She has written several books, including three novels safely locked in a desk drawer.
