**Kanwer Singh AKA Humble the Poet** is a Toronto-bred MC/spoken word artist with an aura that embodies the diversity and resiliency of one of the world's most unique cities. 

At WDS 2019, Kanwer Singh (a.k.a. Humble the Poet) shared his origin story.  He followed his father's advice: to get a good education, became an elementary school teacher but at the same time, fell in love with spoken word art and performance.

On the promise of a potential record deal, he quit his job and went all in to performing. But things didn't go as planned, leaving him $80,000 in debt and with no record deal. He channeled his struggles and pain into vulnerability and honesty which led to a successful book but also new revelations about life.

Now he focuses on "seva", or service -- the idea of using your pain and your experiences to help others. Pain isn't a badge of honor or something to compare with others, but instead something to use to help others, and add beauty and value to the world.
