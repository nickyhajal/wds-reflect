**Kanwer Singh AKA Humble the Poet** is a Toronto-bred MC/spoken word artist with an aura that embodies the diversity and resiliency of one of the world's most unique cities. 

At WDS 2019, Kanwer Singh (a.k.a. Humble the Poet) shared his up-and-down journey of his struggles and success. He now focuses on "seva," or service â€” the idea of using your pain and your experiences to help others. Pain isn't a badge of honor or something to compare with others, but instead something to use to help others, and add beauty and value to the world.
