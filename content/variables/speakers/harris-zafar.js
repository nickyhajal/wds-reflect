**Harris Zafar** is Muslim and is committed to breaking down stereotypes and barriers in our country based on ignorance and intolerance. Harris reminded us that despite the fear and hatred in our world, we're all inherently human, and that means that there is still hope. There's still a chance to connect and see one another for what we really are—not just the labels that society gives us. We need to be the change that we wish to see in the world and start by seeking justice, offering kindness, seeking to establish kinship with others, and make a pledge to do no harm to others.
  
**Harris Zafar** is National Spokesperson for Ahmadiyya Muslim Community USA – among the oldest Muslim organizations in America – and author of book “Demystifying Islam: Tackling the Tough Questions.” From Fox News and CNN to syndicated radio programs, Harris regularly appears on national and local news to address issues facing Islam and the Muslim world while elucidating the need for true pluralism and understanding. A staunch advocate for universal human rights, Harris was praised in a March 2012 motion raised on the floor of the House of Commons in Great Britain for his work defending religious freedom for all. Harris lectures on campuses like Harvard, Yale and Berkeley around the country to provide insight on current issues from an Islamic perspective and also address practical solutions for the world's problems.
  
Driven by a desire to break down misunderstandings and find common ground, Harris passionately works to promote conversation and tolerance between people of diverse backgrounds.  Focusing on the humanity of all people, Harris confronts difficult questions with a commitment to respectful dialogue and truth. If not on television or social media, you can find Harris wearing his "I'm a Muslim, Ask Me Anything" t-shirt every week in order to spark conversation.
