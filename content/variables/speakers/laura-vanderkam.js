**Laura Vanderkam** is the author of several time management and productivity books, including *Off the Clock, I Know How She Does It, What the Most Successful People Do Before Breakfast,* and *168 Hours*. Her work has appeared in publications including the *New York Times, the Wall Street Journal, Fast Company*, and *Fortune*.
      
Laura has spent the past decade studying the ways that successful people manage their time. She teaches people the best ways to maximize the time they have, starting from the simple truth that we all have the same number of hours in any given week. 

She reminded the WDS 2019 audience that you don’t necessarily have to find the perfect time to do something you want to do. Finding the space in your week to accomplish more things becomes easier when you think of your time in weekly increments, and putting the things that matter most to you first.
