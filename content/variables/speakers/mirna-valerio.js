Starting off with a beautiful song, Mirna shared with the WDS 2018 audience about stereotypes and embracing multiple identities for herself being a singer, mother, a teacher, an athlete, and a wife. A medical scare became a catalyst for her to start running, battling the limitations and pre conceived notions that people might have about her. And even though her story was picked up nationally, she also recognizes her own biases towards others and realizing how much we all put others in a box and put limits on each other.
  
**Mirna Valerio** is a native of Brooklyn, NY, a former educator, cross-country coach, ultrarunner, obstacle course enthusiast, and author of the recently published memoir, A Beautiful Work in Progress.

Although she began running in high school, she recommitted to the sport after a health scare in 2008. It was then that her love for running and all its attendant benefits were reignited. She soon started her blog Fatgirlrunning, about her experiences as a larger woman in a world of thinner athletes.

Mirna's athletic story was featured in the _WSJ, Runner’s World_, on the _NBC Nightly News_, _CNN_, on the _CW Network_, and in the viral REI-produced documentary short, The Mirnavator. Her writing has been featured in _Women’s Running Magazine, Self Magazine Online, Outside Online,_ and _Runner's World Magazine_. Most recently, she was chosen as a _2018 National Geographic Adventurer of the Year._
