**Mirna Valerio** is a native of Brooklyn, NY, a former educator, cross-country coach, ultrarunner, obstacle course enthusiast, and author of the recently published memoir, A Beautiful Work in Progress.

Although she began running in high school, she recommitted to the sport after a health scare in 2008. It was then that her love for running and all its attendant benefits were reignited. She soon started her blog Fatgirlrunning, about her experiences as a larger woman in a world of thinner athletes.

Mirna's athletic story was featured in the _WSJ, Runner’s World_, on the _NBC Nightly News_, _CNN_, on the _CW Network_, and in the viral REI-produced documentary short, The Mirnavator. Her writing has been featured in _Women’s Running Magazine, Self Magazine Online, Outside Online,_ and _Runner's World Magazine_. Most recently, she was chosen as a _2018 National Geographic Adventurer of the Year._
