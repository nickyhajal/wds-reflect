At WDS 2018, Adam talked about choosing fear. When you have real freedom, you have to make choices and that's hard. Adam didn't know how to deal with the freedom he was given and had no idea how to make decisions but he really wanted to "do something."

So he traveled to the Middle East during the Arab Spring in search of answers to simple, straight-forward questions. Putting himself in a place that felt dangerous let him avoid the big questions, and he found a purpose in showing the reality of what's actually “safe”.
