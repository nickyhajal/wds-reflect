**Colin O’Brady** is a world record holding explorer and one of the world’s best endurance athletes. Colin is regarded as a foremost expert on mindset.  

He isn’t your typical athlete despite his unmatched athletic accomplishments - a world first solo crossing of Antarctica, a world first row across Drake Passage, summiting Mt. Everest, and setting three prestigious mountaineering world records - and he has done it all after overcoming a devastating accident to prove that anything is possible.
