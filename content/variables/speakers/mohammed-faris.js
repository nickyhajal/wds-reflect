**Mohammed Faris** is an international author, speaker and leader of a community with more than one million people. He started his journey in 2007 when he became obsessed with the question: "Can faith boost productivity?" Mohammed has since spent the last decade trying to answer this question - from his own Islamic faith tradition - his popular blog, [ProductiveMuslim.com](http://ProductiveMuslim.com), and his new book "The Productive Muslim: Where Faith Meets Productivity"

At WDS 2017 Mohammed taught us about the missing soul of productivity - leveraging spirituality to boost our productivity. There's a hidden, spiritual element of success that, in the Islamic tradition, is called "Barakah." This means that Divine goodness attaches to a thing (time, money, space) so you can do more with less, beyond your expectations through mindset, values, and rituatls with sincerity.
