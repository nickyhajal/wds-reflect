At WDS 2018, Geraldine reminded us that online harassment is a real and a very serious thing. The more we acknowledge it, the more we can combat it.

**Geraldine DeRuiter** is a Seattle-based blogger, author, and humorist. She is the voice behind the award-winning [Everywhereist blog](http://www.everywhereist.com/), which *TIME* magazine described as "consistently clever" (Geraldine brings this up all the time, even when it's not relevant to the conversation). 

Her work has appeared in *Refinery 29, The New Yorker's Daily Shouts*, and *The Washington Post*, and one time *The New York Times* described her writing as "dark and hilarious". Her travel memoir, **_All Over The Place: Adventures in Travel, True Love, and Petty Theft_** was published by Public Affairs in 2017. She is currently working on her second book about the nefarious world of social media. You can find her on Twitter: [@everywhereist](https://twitter.com/everywhereist)
