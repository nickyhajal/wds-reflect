At WDS 2018, Ryan talked about his compulsion to say yes to opportunities, even though he's happiest at home on his farm with his family, animals, and nature. Over-working has been a big struggle for him.

Ryan points out how we give away our time when it's actually one of the most valuable resources we have. He uses our mortality as a reminder to make choices to live a better life and value the quiet moments that truly matter.
