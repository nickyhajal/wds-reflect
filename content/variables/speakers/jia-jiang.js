**Jia Jiang** is an entrepreneur and blogger who lives in Austin, Texas. As a teenager in China, he met Bill Gates, which inspired him to come to the United States to pursue his dream of entrepreneurship.

After spending his twenties in the corporate world, he finally made the leap to start his own company, four days before his first child was born. 

After being rejected with an investment opportunity, he started a project to overcome his fear and pain of rejection. By doing so, he discovered a new side of society and encountered countless opportunities. Jiaâ€™s passion is to help people and organizations understand, befriend, and leverage rejection to achieve success.
