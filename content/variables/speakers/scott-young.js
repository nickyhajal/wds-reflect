**Scott Young** is a writer, programmer, traveler and avid reader of interesting things. For the last ten years he’s been experimenting to find out how to learn and think better. Beyond writing, entrepre- neurship and life philosophy, his interests include programming, travel, cooking and teaching himself anything he can. Scott’s new book, _Ultralearning: Master Hard Skills, Outsmart the Competition, and Accelerate Your Career_ will be released later this summer. 

Scott Young encouraged the WDS 2019 audience not to equate learning with school. Instead, he shared the concept of Ultralearning — a self-directed and aggressive strategy for learning. He challenged the community to not focus on the things we are trying to learn or achieve, but to consider the method and motivation needed for achievement.
