At WDS 2018, Cathy reminded the community that everyone is unique and everyone has something to offer. Everyone thinks that they're not enough but you have something that only you can say.

Cathy shared about starting out her podcast, needing to be courageous enough to produce something mediocre until she got better. She learned to tolerate her own inadequacy and be uncomfortable. She challenged the community to try different things and listen to where the world is leading you because it could exceed your wildest dreams.
