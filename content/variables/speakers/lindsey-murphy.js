At WDS 2018, Lindsey shared her journey from climbing the corporate latter quickly, breaking away to discover a passion for science projects, and the love of sharing these projects with children. 

With a couple of seasons under her belt and a goal to produce the show full-time, she recently launched her second crowd-funding campaign and pledged to dedicate an episode to WDS if donations from the community reached $1000. Finally, she challenged the community to create the world we want to see by living out our unique purpose.
