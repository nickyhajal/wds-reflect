**Arlan Hamilton** built a venture capital fund from the ground up, while homeless. She is the Founder and Managing Partner of **[Backstage Capital](https://backstagecapital.com/)**, a fund that is dedicated to minimizing funding disparities in tech by investing in high-potential founders who are people of color, women, and/or LGBT. 

Started from scratch in 2015, Backstage has now raised more than $7 million and invested in more than 130 startup companies led by underestimated founders. In 2018 Arlan co-founded Backstage Studio which launched four accelerator programs for underestimated founders in Detroit, Los Angeles, Philadelphia, and London.
