The world is a pretty scary place for all of us - but exponentially more so for middle- and high-school students, who are still navigating all that adolescence entails: peer pressure, self-esteem issues, bullying, etc. - but it doesn’t have to be bleak!

Justin created **[Project Awake](https://projectawake.org), a unique interactive experience that inspires students to realize their potential, challenges them to overcome self-destructive mediocrity, and empowers them to make positive choices that last a lifetime.

Through the Scholarship for Real Life, Justin will work with schools and artists to produce several live theatrical productions depicting everyday life and highlighting students’ common challenges to show the effects their choices have on one another, and workshops to mitigate violence and aggression in high school students and schools.
