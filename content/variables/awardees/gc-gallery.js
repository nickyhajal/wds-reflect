Calling all emerging artists, art learners, art lovers, and art leaders!  Have you been thinking of ways to make the art world more inclusive and accessible?  Well, 2017 Voyager Jolyn Gardner has set out to create a digital marketplace that showcases and brings to center, the amazing and underrepresented work of emerging artists of the African Diaspora, a group often marginalized and ignored by the traditional art world.

With the help of the Foundation, Jolyn will leverage current technology to create a virtual gallery going experience featuring emerging artists in curated exhibitions and art web series' accessible via smart device along with an art web series.
