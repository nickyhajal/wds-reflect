What would keep you motivated and in good spirits in the heart of an Arctic winter? After living through eight bleak Canadian Februaries in a rural community in Prince Edward County, Krista came up with the idea to alleviate the dreariness and depression that results from months of deep snow and short days. With the community reliant on seasonal tourism, producing **[ICE BOX](https://www.deptofillumination.org/ice-box)** in the off-season will not only boost spirits but also support local artists, struggling during the winter lull.

An immersive public art installation and event that will strengthen the communityâ€™s social fabric and inspire all who visit, ICE BOX will create an unforgettable art experience in the heart of winter for the rural community. At the heart of the event is community engagement, providing a variety of ways for both professional artists and community members to participate and work and play alongside each other. Community participation is very accessible through free or inexpensive programming, with Pay-What-You-Can options available.
