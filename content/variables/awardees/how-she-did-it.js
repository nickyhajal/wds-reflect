Have you ever wondered, “how did she do that?!” Yolanda interviews women of color and explores their career paths to share, via podcast, how they accomplished their goals to inspire other women working to do the same. Formally centered around individuals, this second version of the **[HSDI podcast](https://howshedidit.club/)** will be job-title-centered and share multiple perspectives of the same role.

Through her work, Yolanda creates a community where women of color’s experiences and stories are centered, celebrated, and prioritized...and not an occasional byline. And although not directly her goal, she hopes by focusing on women of color, mainstream media - and employers - will see it’s not that hard to find underrepresented people to highlight and hire, and hopes more WoC would feel excited about where things can go in their own professional lives.
