Wouldn’t you want your children to see themselves in the toys they play with? Like many children, Matthew’s kids love jigsaw puzzles. Matthew and his wife struggled with the lack of representative images in commercially-produced products -- with that in mind, they began creating their own puzzle designs featuring African American characters in positive images.

**[Puzzle Huddle](http://www.puzzlehuddle.com/)** develops and produces a line of culturally inclusive images manufactured as puzzles. These puzzles are a tool for adults and children to spend meaningful time together working on an activity that will also affirm the child and stretch their imagination.

Through the Scholarship for Real Life from WDS Foundation, Matthew and his family will work with illustrators to expand the existing product line to include a broader range of ethnic, gender and demographic representation, emphasizing women in leadership positions, and larger-sized puzzles.
