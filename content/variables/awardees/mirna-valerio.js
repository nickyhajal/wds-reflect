**Mirna Valerio** is a native of Brooklyn, NY, a former educator, cross-country coach, ultrarunner, obstacle course enthusiast, and author of the recently published memoir, *A Beautiful Work in Progress*.

Although she began running in high school, she recommitted to the sport after a health scare in 2008. It was then that her love for running and all its attendant benefits were reignited. She soon started her blog Fatgirlrunning, about her experiences as a larger woman in a world of thinner athletes. 

Mirna's athletic story was featured in the *WSJ, Runner’s World*, on the *NBC Nightly News*, *CNN*, on the *CW Network*, and in the viral REI-produced documentary short, The Mirnavator. Her writing has been featured in *Women’s Running Magazine*, *Self Magazine Online*, *Outside Online*, and *Runner's World Magazine*. Most recently, she was chosen as a *2018 National Geographic Adventurer of the Year*.
